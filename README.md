# ZoeTrack 

> Your personal spiritual growth companion that automatically tracks your prayer life and helps you stay consistent in your walk with God.

## What It Does

ZoeTrack is a spiritual growth tracker that helps Christians maintain consistent devotional habits without the stress of manual tracking. 

You simply tell ZoeTrack your spiritual goals for the week or month in plain English (like talking to a friend), and it automatically creates prayer trackers, organizes your sermon notes, reminds you to listen to messages, and even **detects when you're praying** to track your personal time with God. No more forgotten prayer times or scattered spiritual notes.

## Why It Matters

**The Problem:**

- You miss prayer times because life gets busy and you forget to track them manually
- Your sermon notes, revelations, and spiritual insights are scattered across different apps
- Setting up habit trackers feels like extra work instead of helping your spiritual life
- Most trackers are pass/fail systems that feel legalistic instead of grace-focused

**How We Fix It:**

ZoeTrack removes the friction from spiritual discipline. It automatically detects when you're praying (no manual start button!), intelligently organizes your notes by year/month/category, and uses a grace-focused color system (not just pass/fail) to show your progress. You spend less time tracking and more time actually growing.

## Who It's For

- **Busy Christians**: People who want to grow spiritually but struggle with consistency and tracking
- **Church members**: Believers who take sermon notes and want them organized by date and category
- **Prayer warriors**: Anyone serious about spending quality time with God and wants accountability
- **Ministry leaders**: Pastors and leaders who want to track their spiritual disciplines and message consumption

## Key Features

### 1. Natural Language Goal Setting
Write your spiritual goals conversationally at the start of each week/month. Example: "I want to pray 30 minutes daily for my family, listen to one message per week by Pastor X, and track my joy expressions for 5 minutes daily." ZoeTrack parses this and creates all the trackers automatically.

### 2. Automatic Prayer Detection
The game-changer: ZoeTrack detects when you're praying during the day using context signals (phone stationary, time patterns). It prompts "It sounds like you are praying, should we start tracking it?" and automatically times your prayer session. No manual toggles needed.

### 3. Grace-Focused Color System
Instead of harsh pass/fail tracking, your prayer completion is color-coded:
- ❌ Gray X = Not done (0%)
- ✓🔴 Red = Started but minimal (20-44%)
- ✓🟡 Yellow = Partial completion (45-74%)
- ✓🔵 Blue = Substantial progress (75-94%)
- ✓✅ Green = Complete (95-100%)

This shows progress with grace, not condemnation.

### 4. Smart Message Listening Reminders
Set a goal like "1 message per week by Pastor John." Pick 3 reminder days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday). The app learns your phone usage pattern and asks at the optimal time: "Did you listen to the message?" If not, it tries again on your next reminder day. After the third attempt, it marks the week and resets.

### 5. Hierarchical Note Organization
Your notes are auto-organized:
```
📁 2025
  📁 January
    📁 Church Services
    📁 Mentoring Platform 1
    📁 Perceived God's Dealings: Patience
    📁 Words & Revelations
  📁 February
  📁 March...
```
Folders are created as needed. Duplicate folder structures between months with one tap.

### 6. Action Plan Detection
When you write notes containing action plans (like "I need to fast every Wednesday"), ZoeTrack detects this and prompts: "Create an activity for Wednesday fasting?" One confirmation and it's set up automatically.

### 7. Offline-First Design
Everything works without internet: prayer detection, note-taking, activity tracking. It auto-syncs when you're back online, just like Apple Notes.

## Our Heart Behind This

*"In as much as one is active in church and does congregational prayer, it's time alone spent with God that makes all the difference and I want that to be better for myself and for other believers in the world."*

This app was born from personal struggle with missing prayer times and wanting a better way to track spiritual growth without it feeling like another burden.
